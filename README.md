### The designing process

My preferred approach to building a customized e-commerce stores without using templates is to start by designing it in Figma. Starting with a detailed and structured design ensures that the final product aligns with the brandâ€™s identity while meeting user expectations. To establish the overall aesthetic and tone, I created a style guide that included the color palette, typography (elegant and smooth font styles in varied sizes), button designs in all states, and commonly used UI elements. To maintain consistency, I curated reference images and designed contrasting sections that enhanced visual hierarchy and engagement.

I prioritized responsiveness, ensuring that every page was designed for widescreen displays while maintaining smooth usability across all devices. Following fundamental UX principles, I structured the design for an intuitive experience, making sure interactive elements were predictable yet refined. Strategic use of contrasting sections helped guide user focus to key areas, while large images provided a visually immersive browsing experience. The layout was built with accessibility in mind, ensuring seamless navigation while introducing creative design elements makes the store more distinguished.

### Functionalities and features

The homepage features a full-screen hero section, giving a special first impression. Below, a custom image-based collection display was implemented, offering a dynamic alternative to traditional category listings. There is a dedicated deals section, designed as an alternative collection layout to highlight limited-time offers and promotions effectively. A modal for the newsletter sign-up was introduced to enhance user engagement without disrupting navigation. This allows for a subtle yet effective way to encourage subscriptions while keeping the design clean. Additionally, the product page was fully customized with a interactive gallery changing it's layout depending on screen size.

Subtle hover animations were implemented to enhance user interactions while maintaining the site's smooth and elegant aesthetic. Animations were intentionally kept understated to preserve fluidity without overwhelming the browsing experience. Custom metafields were utilized to provide additional structured data, ensuring better flexibility in content management. The breadcrumb navigation was built from scratch using JavaScript and localStorage, enabling dynamic and persistent navigation without relying on third-party libraries. All custom sections were coded using Liquid schemas, allowing for modular updates while ensuring efficient maintainability.
